                    <p>As an ex-FBI feild agent, I found life a bit boring always beging away from home seeing the great <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/Ecpf1BpR7zMIw/giphy.gif">wonders</a> of our nation, always seeing the worst
                        and best of people, being able to go to crime scene investigation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Top secret missions, constant rigerous training, watching my pensions, 401ks, stocks, bonds grow to <a href="https://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/" target="_blank">numbers that shouldn't exist</a>, and the like was something that needed to change, I had 
                        to do something different in my life, I wanted to stay put for a change.
                    </p>
                    <p>Life was just too easy. I had to do something else, so I decided to pack up my <a href="assets/images/jokes.jpg">family</a> without a clear vision, go put my skills to a <a href="https://alliqtests.com/tests/take_test/5/1/" target="_blank"><i>real </i>test</a>.
                          I applied to a six month boot-camp at UT Austin where I would be grounded and be pushed mentally in ways the FBI could never do!
